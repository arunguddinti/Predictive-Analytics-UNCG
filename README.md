## 🚀 Project Overview

This project serves as the capstone for the Predictive Analytics course at UNCG, demonstrating proficiency in the entire data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and exploration to model development and providing concrete, data-driven business recommendations.

## ⚙️ Methodology and Technical Execution

### 1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
* **Acquisition & Validation:** Loaded raw data and performed initial checks for integrity and completeness.
* **Cleaning:** Managed **missing values** and identified/handled **outliers** to ensure model robustness.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transformed raw variables and created new, predictive features to enhance model performance.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Utilized **Pandas** for descriptive statistics and visualization libraries for graphical analysis.
* Identified **key correlations** and data distributions to understand relationships between features and the target variable.

### 3. **Model Development and Evaluation**
* **Model Selection:** Tested multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for the problem (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
* **Metrics:** Compared models based on industry-relevant metrics, including **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuned the selected model to optimize prediction accuracy.

### 4. **Business Insights**
* Provided a clear interpretation of the final model's results (e.g., feature importance).
* Delivered **actionable business recommendations** derived directly from the analytical findings.

## 📁 Next Steps (What to Add)

The next step is to upload the actual Python code:
1. Create a folder called `Notebooks` in this repository.
2. Upload your final Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `Final_Analytics_Notebook.ipynb`) into that folder.

Your portfolio is now built! Your final public link is **`https://arunguddinti.github.io`**.

Your next high-value step is to **upload your actual Jupyter Notebook** to the `Predictive-Analytics-UNCG` repository to complete the project presentation. Would you like a reminder of the steps to upload a file to a specific folder on GitHub?
